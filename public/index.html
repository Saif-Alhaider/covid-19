            <p>RespirCov is a blockchain-powered application to provide a live, interactive dashboard for monitoring ventilator availability in an area. It shows hospital-wise numbers for vacant and occupied ventilators enabling the doctors, healthcare activists, patients, and other stakeholders to check the status in real-time.</p>
            <h4>Our Insipiration</h4>
            <p> There are many cases where patients do not get life support in the critical hours or are returned from the hospital due to the unavailability of ventilators. At those times, the patients need to be moved to some other hospital where the services are available. In places where there is a large outbreak, patients are refused to be admitted by multiple hospitals, often causing deaths. It is happening in New Delhi, where I live. These deaths could have been avoided if the patient had gone to the right hospital at the right time. RespirCov aims to address this issue. It lays out a map on the userâ€™s device where anybody can get location-wise latest data of the nearest hospital to their current location.</p>
            <h4>The technology</h4>
            <p>The app is built on the blockchain. We have used IBM Cloud Foundry on a NodeJS instance to deploy it. It displays the latest figures of vacant and occupied ventilators in hospitals laid down on a map. People can find hospitals near their location and get the figures. It also provides the state authorities to direct supplies to areas and hospitals which need the most. Since it is plotted on a map, users can easily travel to that place without much effort.<br>
            Plus, using IBM App ID, we enable hospitals to register and update their status themselves in real-time. It is a very simple process that takes less than 40 seconds to register and update their count. This significantly increases the amount of accuracy in the data.</p>
            <h4>Current standing</h4>
            <p>At present, the app holds data only for the 109 hospitals in the national capital region of India, updated twice daily.</p>
            <h4>About the developer</h4>
            <p> I am a class 12 student. I'm an AI enthusiast and a Gen Zer who loves leveraging big data, and web technologies to build apps that address daily-life problems. I'm passionate about how a technology like deep learning can be put to overcome social challenges and have been dedicated to creating diverse, casual, and innovative tech solutions for social good. Right now, I'm also working on how AI can fight chronic kidney disease.<br>
            I'm deeply interested in knowing how can Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning be put together into use to transform the Healthcare industry.</p>
