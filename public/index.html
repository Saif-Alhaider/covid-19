            <hr width=20px><br>
            <p> I am a class 12 student. I'm an AI enthusiast and a Gen Zer who loves leveraging big data, and web technologies to build apps that address daily-life problems. I'm passionate about how a technology like deep learning can be put to overcome social challenges and have been dedicated to creating diverse, casual, and innovative tech solutions for social good. Right now, I'm also working on how AI can fight chronic kidney disease.<br>
            I'm deeply interested in knowing how can Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning be put together into use to transform the Healthcare industry.</p>
